# [Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUjvaMWKeBI) World, a React.js Odyssey

## Mission
The purpose of this project is to learn building React.js applications, together.

## What is this?
This is an evergrowing project, built collectively during live coding sessions. The functionality of the project is just a pretext for integrating various technologies and technique from the React ecosystem (e.g. webpack, ES6, Redux, Native, etc.). 

Think of it as a React.js technology playground. Features will added to support whatever new tech we want to learn. (Dream come true, I know!)

## How to contribute?
1. [Create an Issue](https://github.com/react-bucharest/hello-world/issues/new) with the topic you'd like to cover, where you'll get +1s and feedback from other members.
2. Once agreed upon the deliverable, you submit a PR and ask for feedback.
3. Once your code is reviewed and approved, your PR becomes eligible for a live coding session at [React.js Bucharest](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1633618413528676/).
4. During the live event, you first hold a brief presentation about what you're about to code.
5. After the intro, you grab the editor and live code your PR from scratch, explaining each step as you go.
6. :tada:

## Roadmap
Coming soon.
